		MYSHELL: {tul53850@temple.edu}

program: myshell [option]

description:
a simple shell with I/O redirection, and pipes. Shell can be activated with a batch file. To do this, when executing myshell, include a batch file path in the command line.

To use I/O redirection:
"programname arg1 arg2 < inputfie > outputfile"
this command line will execute the program with arguments arg1 and arg2, the stdin FILE stream replaced by inputfile and stdout FILE stream replaced by outputfile.
if the output character is '>', then the outputfile is created or overwritten. if '>>' is used, then outputfile is created or appended.

To use background execution:
Run your command with an '&' at the end and the shell will not wait for the program before prompting again.

To use pipes:
"cat out.txt | wc -1"
the '|' character is used to declare a pipe. In this example, the output of cat is redirected to the input for wc.


Contains built-in commands listed below:

cd <argument>
changes the directory to the argument. If no argument is supplied, it simply displays the current working directory.

clr

dir <argument>

environ

echo <argument>

help

pause
Pause operation of the shell until 'Enter' is pressed.
